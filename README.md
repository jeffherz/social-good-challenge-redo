## Another attempt at a challenge problem that was given at the JPMC Social Good Hackathon on July 12. ##

## Challenge Description - Financial Literacy

### Context

One of the biggest challenges for young adults today is the lack of financial education and resources in the face of a rising debt crisis.  Young people, especially in underserved communities, have entered this financial downturn over the last year with fewer resources than previous generations and find themselves unprepared, overwhelmed, and at greater risk.  We also know that young adults in Black and Hispanic communities face an even greater disparity and wealth gap than faced by white counterparts.  The early education system alone doesn't always provide the right resources and preparation for young people to navigate financial situations and make informed choices that could affect their finances for the future.

While technology is not the overall solution to the problem, is there a practical way for technology to help educate young adults about financial planning at an earlier age and build skills that help reduce and avoid debt, build savings, and improve overall financial capability?  Can technology help connect young people early on with the right resources to succeed in planning their next steps such as higher education, career path, loan management, etc. and build skills to lead them along the financial continuum?

### Challenge 

Build a web or mobile application that can be introduced at an early age that can get young adults on the right track to prepare for and make informed decisions about their finances.  Consider some of the following of what this technology could help answer:  how to get information on what career paths are out there, what educational opportunities or trainings to explore to reach your career aspirations and the finances associated with them, what resources are available to help navigate different situations, and how to build and sustain overall financial literacy throughout life.

### While participating in the Social Good Hackathon, my group decided to make a website that allowed a user to specify what they were thinking about doing after high school and give them websites and resources that could help them figure out *What's Next*.
